The application will be accesible via Guacamole in the following URL: 
  {{ .Values.guacamoleConnectionCreation.guacamoleUrl }}
 
There should be a connection created for that desktop with the following name: 
  {{ include "desktop-tensorflow.connectionName" . }}

Once in the desktop, there will be three important directories:
  - {{ include "chaimeleon.datasets.mount_point" . }}
    [All the datasets you selected to work with]
    
  - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_home.mount_point" . }}
    [Private persistent storage: for your algoritms, results and whatever you need for the work]
    
  - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_shared_folder.mount_point" . }}
    [Public storage where you can share files with the other CHAIMELEON users]
