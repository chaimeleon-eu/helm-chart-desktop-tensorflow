When the application is ready it will be accesible via Guacamole in the following URL: 
  {{ include "chaimeleon.guacamole-url" . }}
 
There should be a connection created for that desktop with the following name: 
  {{ include "desktop-tensorflow.connectionName" . }}
It can take few seconds to appear (refresh the page if you do not see it).

Once in the remote desktop, remember...

    To show/hide the Guacamole menu: CTRL+SHIFT+ALT

    There will be three important directories:
      - {{ include "chaimeleon.datasets.mount_point" . }}
        [All the datasets you selected to work with]
        
      - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_home.mount_point" . }}
        [Private persistent storage: for your algoritms, results and whatever you need for the work]
        
      - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_shared_folder.mount_point" . }}
        [Public storage where you can share files with the other CHAIMELEON users]
